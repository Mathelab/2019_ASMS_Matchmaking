# Bridging the Gap between Computational Biology and Biology: Matchmaking Session
### ASMS 2019, Atlanta.
### Wednesday June 8th at 5:45-7pm, Room A313

*Goal*: To discuss methods to bridge the language and culture gap between computational biology and biology.  A secondary aim is to help researchers find each other in this large conference setting. 

*Format*: The session will be split into three parts: 1) brief introduction; 2) all participants share their work in 3-5 minutes; 2) informal, small group discussions (led by moderators), where tool developers/analysis experts interact with bench scientists/novice researchers to identify common interests and foster future conversations/collaborations.  Topics will include broad aspects of metabolomics analysis, from data preprocessing, to statistical analyses and data interpretation.

*Topics*: broad aspects of metabolomics analysis, from data preprocessing, to statistical analyses and data interpretation.

### This is a very interactive session and if you have a topic you’d like to introduce, let us know!
