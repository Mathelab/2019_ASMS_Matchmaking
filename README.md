# Bridging the Gap between Computational Biology and Biology: Matchmaking Session
### ASMS 2019, Atlanta.
### Wednesday June 8th at 5:45-7pm, Room A313

*Goal*: To discuss methods to bridge the language and culture gap between computational biology and biology.  A secondary aim is to help researchers find each other in this large conference setting. 

*Format*: The session will be split into three parts: 
  1) Brief introduction by co-organizers Ewy and Corey (15 min)
  2) Invitation for participants to share share their work in 3-5 minutes (20 min) 
  3) Informal, small group discussions (slightly under 1 hour), where tool developers/analysis experts interact with bench scientists/novice researchers to identify common interests and foster future conversations/collaborations.  

*Topics*: broad aspects of computational analysis (primarily for high-throughput assays), from data preprocessing, to statistical analyses and data interpretation.

*Outcome*: a list of approaches that help facilitate briding the gap between different fields. Emphasis will be placed on the process and solutions, rather than on a list of problems encountered.


### This is a very interactive session and if you have a topic you’d like to introduce, let us know!
